I'm Mohammad Reza, an AI enthusiast with a background in Software Engineering and a deep interest in the human brain. I founded Giftak, a startup in the game services industry, during my Bachelor's. Now, as a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence, I’m focused on research in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), specifically analyzing EEG signals to understand brain activity. My work employs techniques like convolutional neural networks, wavelet transforms, and blind source separation to explore brain function, with the aim of improving diagnostics and neuroimaging. Recently, I’ve been working on applying vision transformers and the xDAWN algorithm to EEG data, and I’m keen to connect with others in the field to advance BCI technology.
