I am a Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence, specializing in Brain-Computer Interfaces and Machine Learning.

My research interests include analyzing EEG signals to advance brain activity understanding, with a dedication to improving diagnostics and neuroimaging through BCI technology. I am open to connecting with fellow researchers and professionals to collaborate on innovative projects in this field.
