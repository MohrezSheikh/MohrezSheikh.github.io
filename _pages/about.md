Hi, I’m Mohammad Reza, an AI enthusiast with a Bachelor's in Software Engineering and founder of Giftak, a game services startup. I'm now pursuing a Master's in AI and working as a graduate research assistant focusing on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). My research involves analyzing EEG signals using techniques like multi-layer convolutional neural networks, wavelet transforms, and blind source separation to understand brain activity. This work aims to improve diagnoses and develop new neuroimaging applications. I’m passionate about unlocking the potential of BCI through EEG signals and recently explored using vision transformers and the xDAWN algorithm for EEG data analysis. Let's connect and explore the exciting possibilities in this field!
