I'm Mohammad Reza, an AI enthusiast fueled by a fascination with the human brain. My journey began with a Bachelor's in Software Engineering, where I honed my skills in Artificial Intelligence. During this time, I wasn't just learning, I was building! I founded Giftak, a startup in the game services industry, demonstrating my passion for applying AI in real-world projects.

Now, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, further propelling me towards the frontiers of this dynamic field. As a graduate research assistant, I'm actively contributing to advancements in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). My current research focuses on analyzing EEG signals to understand brain activity. I leverage techniques like multi-layer convolutional neural networks to integrate temporal and spectral features, and wavelet transforms for spectro-temporal analysis. Additionally, I employ wavelet and blind source separation techniques to dissect the structure and temporal changes in brain activity across different regions and frequencies.  This research is particularly exciting as it has the potential to improve diagnoses and develop new neuroimaging applications.

My current fascination lies in unlocking the potential of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) through EEG signals. I'm particularly interested in how these signals can be used to understand brain function and communication. My recent project explored the application of vision transformers and the XDAWN algorithm in analyzing EEG data. I'm constantly seeking new ways to leverage EEG signals and contribute to advancements in BCI technology. Let's connect and explore the exciting possibilities of this field together!
